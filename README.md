# Beat Mix

Welcome to my beat making project. Feel free to start making some dope beats. Have Fun!! :)


## How To Begin


Once you have the project downloaded, you'll need to run some terminal commands to get the application started. First, open the root project directory in your terminal. 
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies of this project. 
- Once it has finished installing, you can run `npm run start` to begin your server. You'll see `Server listening on port 4001` in the terminal.   - You'll have to have your server running to ensure that the program runs correctly and that you get to hear the drum beats! 
- You can end your server process with a `Ctrl + C` shortcut in the terminal window.


## Build
- This project was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Along with the help of express for the backend:  [Express](https://expressjs.com/)!
