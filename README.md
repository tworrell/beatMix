# Beat Mix

## Project Overview


## How To Begin


Once you have the project downloaded, you'll need to run some terminal commands to get the application started. First, open the root project directory in your terminal. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies of this project. Once it has finished installing, you can run `npm run start` to begin your server. You'll see `Server listening on port 4001` in the terminal. You'll have to have your server running to ensure that the code you write runs correctly and that you get to hear your drum beats! You can end your server process with a Ctrl + C shortcut in the terminal window.
